## Overall Assessment: **Solid Opening** (B+)

You made several strong decisions, but there are a few areas for optimization.

---

## What You Did Well ✓

### City Placement (A-)
Stockholm settled at (32,9) - a reasonable spot with access to flood plains and a wheat resource. You have 3 flood plains in range which is excellent for food.

### Early Build Order (A)
Scout production is the right choice. Scouts are critical for:
- Finding ancient ruins (huge early bonuses)
- Locating city-states and AI civs
- Identifying good expansion spots
- You'll finish it in 5 more turns

### Tech Path (B+)
Pottery is a solid second tech for getting a shrine, though I'd want to see what you discovered first.

### Exploration
Your warrior headed southeast and found Melbourne (city-state). Your scout went north exploring coastal/tundra areas.

---

## Areas for Improvement ⚠️

### Tile Management (C)
**This is your biggest issue!** Stockholm is working:
- City center (2 food, 1 production)
- Wheat tile (2 food, 1 production)

But you're set to Production Focus with **1 turn until growth**. Here's the problem:
- You have 4 food/turn and 5 production/turn
- You're about to grow to pop 2, which will consume 2 more food
- You're NOT working any of your flood plains (2 food each)!

**Better approach:** With growth imminent, you should be working food-heavy tiles. Work the wheat (2f/1p) + a flood plain (2f/0p) = 4 food, 1 production. This keeps strong growth momentum.

### Gold Accumulation
You have 152 gold banked but only +2 gpt. This suggests you haven't met Melbourne yet with a unit to get the gold bonus. Always try to meet city-states early for the 30-40 gold reward.

### Scout Positioning
Your scout is exploring north into tundra/snow/ice - very low priority terrain. Generally scout toward grassland/plains first as that's where you'll find:
- Better city locations
- Other civs
- Ruins with better rewards

## Key Stats Check

| Metric         | Value            | Assessment                      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Population** | 1 (→2 in 1 turn) | ✓ Expected                      |
| **Science**    | 4/turn           | ✓ Good for pop 1                |
| **Culture**    | 1/turn           | Only from palace, no monument   |
| **Happiness**  | 5                | Fine, but will drop as you grow |
| **Military**   | 2 units          | ✓ Adequate (Scout + Warrior)    |
| **Gold**       | 152 (+2/turn)    | High reserves, low income       |

## Military & Exploration

- **Location:** (32, 5) - Tundra Forest
- **Status:** Exploring northern tundra/coastal areas
- **Health:** 100/100

### Warrior (Level 1)
- **Location:** (42, 14) - Desert
- **Status:** Exploring southeast, near Melbourne
- **Health:** 100/100

---

## Technology Progress

**Researched:**
- Agriculture ✓

**Current Research:**
- Pottery (4 turns remaining)

---

## Diplomatic Contacts

**City-States:**
- Melbourne (Attitude: None, Not at war)

---

## Recommendations Going Forward

1. **Immediately:** Change Stockholm's focus from Production to Food or Default to work better tiles
2. **Next build:** Monument (culture is important for policies) or another Scout
3. **Scout movement:** Redirect south/east toward better terrain and potential ruins
4. **Warrior:** Keep exploring, meet Melbourne if you haven't already for the gold bonus
5. **Tech:** After Pottery, consider Animal Husbandry (reveals horses) or Mining (for production improvements)

---

## Summary

Your opening is fundamentally sound - good settle location, good build order, decent exploration. The main refinement is being more intentional with citizen management to maximize growth in these critical early turns!

The combination of flood plains and wheat gives Stockholm excellent growth potential. Focus on leveraging that food advantage to reach higher population quickly, which will accelerate science and production in the mid-game.
